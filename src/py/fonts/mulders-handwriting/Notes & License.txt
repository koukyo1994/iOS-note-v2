A rendering of my actual handwriting. Started as a side project at the Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague back in 2004.
First released 29 april 2004. But recently added some additional characters.
If you want to use the font comercially please contact me on mulder@peltenburg.eu
But also if you have used the font for a personal project drop me a line. It's always fun to see my work in action :)
Cheers, Merijn Mulder
