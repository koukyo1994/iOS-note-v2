\section{Future Work \& Conclusion}
\label{section:conclusion}

The goal of this report is to create an application to recognize sentences
on iOS for documents where handwritten illustrations and characters were mixed.
Although it is imperfect, the heuristic used for region of interest detection successfully
detect a word out of a sentence, and can cut handwritten illustration out from the other
part of document without requreing large amount of computation.
On the other hand, text recognition had a trade-off between speed and accuracy.

Future tasks include improving the accuracy of text recognition without slowing it down.
Another example of future work is to perform more accurate text recognition and ROI detection
using an online method. In auto-completion, prediction using information on surrounding words,
and refinement of the method of presenting complement candidates can also be one of future works.
