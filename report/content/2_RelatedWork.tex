\section{Related Work}

The problem settings of this project can be positioned as one variant of Scene Text Detection/Recognition, which
is a field to study algorithms to extract and recognize text information written in natural images.
Due to the recent development of Neural Networks technology,
much research has been done in this field to this day~\cite{long2018scene}.\\
Except for few methods\cite{liu2018fots}\cite{lyu2018mask}, most approaches of Scene Text Detection/Recognition
separate detection and recognition and perform stepwise inference.

\subsection{Detection}

Scene Text Detection can be subsumed under general object detection, therefore those methods usually follow
the same procedure of object detection, which is dichotomized as one-stage methods and two-stage ones~\cite{liu2018deep}.\\

Object detection methods after the emergence of Object detection methods are

\subsection{Recognition}

Some text recognition algorithms devide the task into character segmentation and character recognition~\cite{bissacco2013photoocr}\cite{phan2011gradient}.
character segmentation is not currently widely used
since it can be a cause of errors when separating connected characters such as cursive,
but there is also a merit that it is only necessary to use a simpler character recognition method
instead of text recognition in the subsequent processing.
