\section{Related Work}

The problem settings of this project can be positioned as one variant of Scene Text Detection/Recognition, which
is a field to study algorithms to extract and recognize text information written in natural images.
Due to the recent development of Neural Networks technology,
much research has been done in this field to this day~\cite{long2018scene}.\\
Except for few methods\cite{liu2018fots}\cite{lyu2018mask}, most approaches of Scene Text Detection/Recognition
separate detection and recognition and perform stepwise inference.

\subsection{Detection}

Scene Text Detection can be subsumed under general object detection, therefore those methods usually follow
the same procedure of object detection, which is dichotomized as one-stage methods and two-stage ones~\cite{liu2018deep}.\\

While most of Scene Text Detection approaches in the era of Deep Learning detect sentence region from input images,
some other methods use character segmentation for the purpose.

\subsection{Recognition}
